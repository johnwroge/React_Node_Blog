# Big_O_Blog

The problem this project aims to solve is to have a general purpose blog that can easily be configured to a developer's needs. Sites like Wordpress offer styling and functional customizability, but do not offer developers complete control of the code to practice practicing with different tools. For this reason, I am creating this project as a way to experiment with different tech stacks for frontend and backend functionality.
